# ML-IDS-CICIDS2017

## Intrusion Detection System Using CICIDS2017

This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a machine learning model to detect network threats in real-time using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The dataset includes various attack types, such as DDoS, brute force attacks, and web attacks, providing a realistic scenario for intrusion detection system (IDS) testing.

**NOTE:** Due to its large size, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it directly from the [CICIDS2017 dataset page](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html).

## Project Documentation  

The project is written in a Jupyter Notebook format, accompanied by explanations and documentation. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the entire process, from data preparation to model evaluation.
