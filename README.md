# ML-IDS-CICIDS2017
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for real-time network threat detection using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The model is designed to identify and classify network traffic as either benign or malicious, leveraging various machine learning techniques.
